## Section 2 — The Problem

**Section label:** THE CHALLENGE EVERY PARENT KNOWS

**Card 1 — "Team training isn't enough"**
Your child trains once or twice a week with their club, but so does every other player. The ones who pull ahead are getting individual work done outside of team sessions.

**Card 2 — "You want to help but you're not a coach"**
You'd do anything to help them improve, but without a professional eye on their game, you don't know what to work on.

**Card 3 — "Generic coaching won't cut it"**
Every player is different. Group sessions can't focus on what your child specifically needs to develop.

## Section 5 — What a Session Covers

**Headline:** Personalised Coaching, Every Session

**Feature 1 — Technical Development**
Ball mastery, first touch, passing, finishing — focused on the areas your child needs most.

**Feature 2 — Game Understanding**
Positioning, movement, decision-making. The things that separate good players from smart players.

**Feature 3 — Confidence Building**
Players who believe in their ability perform better. Rene builds confidence through competence — not empty praise.

**Feature 4 — Honest Feedback**
You'll know exactly where your child is, what they're working on, and how they're progressing. No guesswork.
